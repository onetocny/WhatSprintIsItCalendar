# What Sprint It Is Calendar

An ics file provider of Azure DevOps sprints. As [WhatSprintIs.It](https://whatsprintis.it/) provides nice view of current sprint, this repo generates a calendar containing such information. Such calendar might be imported to your Outlook, Google Calendar etc.

**TODO**
- Clean up repo
- Load settings (such as first sprint date, sprint length) from configuration,
- Generate ics file recurently, store it in blob and then provide it through API
